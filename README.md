# PlayerGuess
guess the baseball player based on their stats!

Put an MLB.com player ID in the URL as a parameter (ie hedstnd.github.io/PlayerGuess?547180 for Bryce Harper) or put no parameters in for a random player from MLB history!

To limit the stats to certain years, use these parameters: playerId for MLB.com player ID, startYear for the start year of stats, and endYear for the last year to display! You can also use only one of startYear and endYear if you only want to show the beginning or end of someone's career
usage example: hedstnd.github.io/playerGuess?playerId=547180&startYear=2019&endYear=2022 would show Bryce Harper's first four years with the Phillies (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)
